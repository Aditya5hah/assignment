		<h2>Introduction:</h2>
		<p>Aim of this report was to portray how the webpage was made and the code used on the webpage. The webpage was designed for every sector because it is easy to use webpage which will be familiar with every people.
		</p>
        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>The main and the most important objective of this webpage was to learn how things work together like HTML and CSS and have at least some experience on this sector. Saying this in simple words HTML to make fairly designed outlet and in the other hand CSS to make it more pleasant to watch and presentable.
        </p>
        <h2>Experience:</h2>
        <p>Though our assignment was interesting we had a lot of competitions challenging us like plagiarism. We had a wide range of marking scheme provided so we could understand how markings were done. But we ha limitations for some features. Making the webpage responsive was tough too. I had a lot of changes on my color changes on my webpage because I wanted the viewers to feel comfortable while looking at my webpage. Home page is very simple looking it has an image place holder and a welcome message and a button which will redirect you to blog page. Portfolio also has an image place holder and some of my interests. Contact page has 3 fill up sections to have viewers information. At last I validate my codes and there were some unnecessary mistakes and some mistakes were solved. I used CSS to 	decorate my form so it would look pleasent nd clesn while looking at it(W3School)
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>At last after all the hard work and tough times I learned how I should fight back my fears. Coding is fun it seems after the farewell of the assignment.</p>
