		<p><i>“I stared my assignment on 22nd feb, 2022. It was bit of a new thing for me but I came up with this after all my hard work. So, I did all my coding from Sublime text. At first, I designed my home page and then slowly I completed all my pages. I tried unique colors and colors which will not disturb our eyes. I found out coding is not so easy on MacBook but I figured my way out. Had few sleepless nights due to pressure because like I have already addressed this was all new to me. We were asked to push our work at least 3 times on github and “github” was such a magical thing that I’m so glad I came across this. At first, I designed my index I had many ideas on my mind but I came up with a simple one so it would be easy later. I also added image placeholder so I could replace it with some other images later. In place of logo I just wrote my name but with a different font style so it would look good but at the same time it would look neat. I wrote some of my interests on the portfolio page.”</i></p>
